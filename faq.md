# Frequently Asked Questions

## Purpose of this Dashboard

This dashboard is meant to evaluate insurance quotes by slicing-and-dicing over potential policyholder characteristics.

## How to Use

First, use the Select Field(s) menu to select 1 or more fields to aggregate over. Usually only one field is sufficient, but two or more fields can be used if you are interested in the interaction of multiple variables.

Second, optionally use the Select Filter(s) menu to select 0 or more filters to apply to the dataset. Once a filter field is selected, you can decide what values are important. Use the "Include matching rows" checkbox if you want to include the values you selected or uncheck the checkbox if you want to exclude the values you selected.

Thirdly, review the Exhibit menu to see the results of your selections.
